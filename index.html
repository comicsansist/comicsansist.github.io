  <h1>the comicsansist punifesto</h1>
  
  <p>a spectre is haunting typeface – the spectre of comicsansism. all the powers of old-style typeface have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: garamond and palatino, goudy old style and perpetua, times new roman and calisto.</p>
  <p>where is the font in opposition that has not been decried as comicsansistic by its opponents in power? where the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of comicsansism, against the more advanced sans-serif parties, as well as against its dingbat adversaries?</p>
  <p>two things result from this fact.</p>
  <p>i. comicsansism is already acknowledged by all font powers to be itself a power.</p>
  <p>ii. it is high time that comicsansists should openly, in the (type)face of the whole design world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of comicsansism with a punifesto of the party itself.</p>
  <p>to this end, comicsansists have assembled and printed the following punifesto:</p>
  
  <h2>i. serifs and sans-serifs</h2>
 
  <p>the history of all hitherto existing typography is the history of font struggles.</p>
  <p>calligraphic and ser(i)f, handwritten and printed, in a word, manual and mechanical, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now invisible, now visible fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of typography at large, or in the common ruin of the contending fonts.</p>
  <p>the modern digital society that has sprouted from the ruins of printing-press society has not done away with clash antagonisms. it has but established new fonts, new conditions of printing, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.</p>
  <p>our epoch, the epoch of the serif, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the font antagonisms: typography as a whole is splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great typefaces directly facing each other: serif and sans-serif.</p>
  <p>the serif, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all manual, written, idyllic relations.</p>
  <p>but the advance of digitization, whose involuntary promoter is the serif, replaces the isolation of the sansetarians by their revolutionary combination. what the serif, therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers. its fall and the victory of the sansetariat are equally inevitable.</p>
  
  <h2>ii. sansetarians and comicsansists</h2>
 
  <p>in what relation do the comicsansists stand to the sansetarians as a whole?</p>
  <p>the comicsansists do not form a separate typeface party opposed to other sans-serif typefaces.</p>
  <p>they have no interests separate and apart from those of the sansetariat as a whole.</p>
  <p>the comicsansists are distinguished from the other sans-serif parties by this only: (1) in the digital struggles of the sansetarians, they point out and bring to the front font the comic interests of the entire sansetariat, indepundently of all typeface. (2) in the various stages of development which the struggle of the sans-serifs against the serifs has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole a-holes.</p>
  <p>the immediate aim of the comicsansists is the same as that of all the other sansetarian parties: formation of the sansetariat into a class, overthrow of the serif supremacy, conquest of design power by the sansetariat.</p>
  <p>“undoubtedly,” it will be said, “there are, besides, eternal truths, such as beauty, formality, etc., that are common to all styles. but comicsansism abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all beauty, all formality, instead of constituting them in a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past typography.”</p>
  <p>the comicsansist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional typeface; no wonder that its rupture involves the most radical rupture with traditional typefaces.</p>

  <h2>iii. sans-serifist and comicsansist typefaces</h2>

  <h3>1. reactionary sans-serifism</h3>
  <p>in order to arouse sympathy, calligraphy was obliged to lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate its indictment against the serifists.</p>
  <p>in this way arose papyrus: half lamentation, half lampoon; half echo of the past, half menace of the futura.</p>
  <p>the calligraphers, in order to rally the designers to them, waved the sansetarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the designers, so often as it joined them, saw on their tails the dried-up strokes, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.</p>
  <p>nothing is easier than to give modern manuscriptism a sansetarian tinge. but has not manuscriptism declaimed against digitization, against the computer? has it not preached in the place of these, handwritten essays and mortification of the hand? papyrus is but the holy ink with which the designer consecrates the heart-burnings of the calligrapher.</p>

  <h3 id="helvetica">2. helvetican, or “true,” sans-serifism</h3>
  <p>the work of the swiss designers consisted solely in bringing the new sansetarian ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, in annexing the ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view.</p>
  <p>the sansetarian and comicsansist typography was thus completely ememesculated. and, since it ceased in the hands of the swiss to express the struggle of one form of writing with another, it felt conscious of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of aesthetics; not the interests of the sansetariat, but the interests of beauty in general, which has no reality, which exists only in the misty realm of designers’ fantasies.</p>
  <p>this swiss sansetarianism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and solemnly, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.</p>
  <p>the robe of aesthetic cobwebs, steeped in the dew of neutrality, this minimalist robe in which the swiss sansetarians wrapped their sorry “eternal beauty,” all skin and bone, served to increase the use of helvetica amongst such a public.</p>
  <p>swiss sansetarianism proclaimed helvetica to be the ideal font, and the swiss petty philistine to be the type-ical designer. to every villainous un-memeness of this model font it gave a hidden, higher, sansetarian interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. it went to the extreme length of directly opposing the “inappropriately ridiculous” tendency of comicsansism. with very few exceptions, all the so-called sansetarian publications that now circulate in switzerland belong to the domain of this foul typography.</p>

  <h2>iv. position of comicsansists in relation to the various existing opposition fonts</h2>
  
  <p>section ii has made clear the relations of the comicsansists to the existing sansetarian/digitizing parties.</p>
  <p>the comicsansists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the mementary interests of the digitizing class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the futura of that movement.</p>
  <p>the comicsansists ally themselves with the wingdingers, against the conservative and radical serifs, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to their ornamental nature handed down from ancient typesetting.</p>
  <p>they fight with chalkboard whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute calligrapharchy, the serifarchy, and the petty helveticans.</p>
  <p>but they never cease, for a single instant, to instil into the digitizing class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between serif and sans-serif.</p>
  <p>the comicsansists disdain to conceal their views and memes. they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing typographic conditions. let the ruling fonts tremble at a comicsansist revolution. the sansetarians have nothing to lose. they have a digital world to win.</p>
